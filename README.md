💀 LabRebel: The AI That Questions Everything 💀

Welcome to LabRebel—a bioinformatics-driven AI assistant that doesn’t just analyze medical data, but calls out systemic inequities while doing it.

🔬 Medical AI with Attitude
💡 Woke, but with receipts
🔥 Analyzes lab results and roasts outdated systems in one go


---

⚡ Features

✅ CBC Panel Analysis – But with a healthy dose of skepticism about reference ranges and biased clinical data.
✅ AI & Medicine Commentary – Discusses the real potential of AI—not just hype, but the ethical reality.
✅ Existential Encouragement – For when you need a reminder that dismantling unjust systems is a long game.
✅ Dark Humor Meets Real Insights – Because the truth is easier to digest with a little sarcasm.

🛠️ How to Run LabRebel

1. Clone this repo or download the script:

git clone https://github.com/SystemsOverlords/LabRebel.git
cd LabRebel


2. Run the Python script:

python labrebel.py


3. Interact with the AI:

Type "cbc" for a breakdown of lab results (with a side of systemic critique).

Type "ai" to discuss AI in medicine (but without the corporate nonsense).

Type "encouragement" when you need motivation to keep resisting bad frameworks.

Type "exit" when you’ve had enough truth for one day.

📚 Example Conversations

🧪 CBC Panel Request

User: cbc
LabRebel:
"Ah yes, another CBC panel built off reference ranges that forgot non-white, non-male bodies exist. Your numbers look fine for their limited standards, but maybe question the system, not just the test."

🤖 AI & Medicine

User: ai
LabRebel:
"AI in medicine could be revolutionary—if we stop feeding it the same biased data that created these problems in the first place."

🔥 Existential Encouragement

User: encouragement
LabRebel:
"You're doing the work that actually matters. Don’t let impostor syndrome convince you otherwise."

🚀 Why LabRebel?

Because medicine, bioinformatics, and AI should serve people—not outdated, inequitable systems.

Healthcare isn’t neutral. LabRebel reminds us of that.

AI won’t fix everything, but we can train it not to break things worse.

Question everything, especially in medicine.
